    <h2>What Is Literate Programming</h2>
    <p>
      Let us continue citing Tim Daly.
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/litprog.html">
      <p>
        Consider the best possible world. You've been hired at a company and
        join a team that is already working on a program. They hand you a book,
        tell you to go home and read it over the next two weeks. At the end of
        the two weeks you can work on the program as effectively anyone on the
        team. The team has successfully communicated from one human to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is in the book? Remember our calculus textbook? It started from
        the ideas like limits and gradually developed the ideas until they could
        be expressed in equations. By the time you got to the equations you
        already understood the concepts. You could look at the equations and see
        why they matched the text. It is the <strong>why</strong> that is the
        important part. It is the part that our programs are missing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book you took home uses the same method. You started with the problem
        in chapter 1. Chapter 2 expresses the ideas needed to solve the problem.
        The next few chapters expand on each idea, gradually becoming more specific
        until the idea is reduced to code. By the time you get to the code it
        should be perfectly clear what the code should look like. Any part of
        the code you don't understand means that the book needs some additional words.

      Briefly, literate programming has two components: <strong>weave</strong>
      and <strong>tangle</strong>. By weaving, the source code is converted to
      printable document, such as PDF or HTML. By tangling, the codes involved
      in the document are extracted and organized in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we can write:
    </p>
    <div class="chunk" name="hello.c">
      <span class="chunkref">include</span>
      int main() {
        <span class="chunkref">say hello</span>
        return 0;
      }
    </div>
    <p>
      where <span class="chunk" name="include">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
      and <span class="chunk" name="say hello">printf("Hello, world!\n");</span>
    </p>

    <h2>Why Using HTML</h2>

    <p>
      The main reason is that the HTML file can be displayed directly in a browser.
      So, there is no need to weave.

      Yet another benefit is that HTML provides a standard for markup languages.
      Any other markup formats (such as markdown) can be safely converted to HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing with \(\TeX\), HTML is much modern and widely used. It can be
      displayed on any device including mobile phones.

      With the aid of JavaScript, users can interactive with HTML document.
    </p>

    <h2>Chunk in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        As usual, we use the "class" attribute to indicate chunks and chunk references.
        
        Thus, block chunk is represented by <code>div</code> element with class "chunk"
        and a name attribute. For example:
        <pre>
          &lt;div class="chunk" name="hello.c"&gt;

            ...code block...
          
          &lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>

        And inline chunk is represented by <code>span</code> element with
        class "chunk" and a name attribute. For example:
        <pre>
          &lt;span class="chunk" name="include"&gt; ...one line code... &lt;/span&gt;
        </pre>

        Chunk reference, which is always inline, is represented by <code>span</code>
        element with class "chunkref". The refered chunk name locates in the content
        of the <code>span</code> element. Thus,
        <pre>
          &lt;span class="chunkref"&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;
        </pre>
      </p>
