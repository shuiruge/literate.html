<h2>1.0 Literate Programming - A Gentle Introduction</h2>
<h3>1.1 What is the problem?</h3>
<p>
In the 1970s I worked on a PDP11/40, which is the same class of
machine that was used to develop UNIX. My PDP had 8192 bytes of
memory. The editor used 4096 bytes and left the other 4096 bytes for
an edit buffer.
</p><p>
This meant that the largest file I could create at any time was 4096
bytes.  As a result, C programs were limited in size. To get around
this problem we used <tt>include</tt> files, libraries of code,
linkers, and overlay loaders.  Segment registers exist on the x86
processors to help overlay loaders.
</p><p>
People program today the same way I programmed in the 1970s.  We write
programs that are made of tiny pieces of sand in hundreds of little
files spread across dozens of directories. In order to find anything
we use grep to search files, or we create tools to pre-search
the files such as Eclipse and IntelliJ.
</p><p>
Imagine taking the same approach to calculus. Create a directory for
each chapter. Take each equation in the chapter and put it in a file.
Do this for every chapter. Throw away the textbook. <b>Now try to learn
calculus</b>.
</p><p>
That's the way we program today, just like I did in the 1970s.
</p><p>
We program to communicate to the machine, not to communicate to people.<br/>
<b>That's the problem</b>.
</p>

<h3>1.2 Is there a better way?</h3>
<blockquote>
In my life as an architect, I find that the single thing which inhibits
young professionals, new students most severely, is their acceptance of
standards that are too low. If I ask a student whether her design is as
good as Chartres, she often smiles tolerantly at me as if to say, "Of
course not, that isn't what I am trying to do...I could never do that."
<br/><br/>
Then, I express my disagreement, and tell her: "That standard must be 
our standard. If you are going to be a builder, no other standard is
worthwhile."
<br/>
--Christopher Alexander, May 1996 in (Patterns of Software, Gabriel)
<br/>
</blockquote>
<p>
Consider the best possible world. You've been hired at a company and
join a team that is already working on a program. They hand you a book,
tell you to go home and read it over the next two weeks. At the end of
the two weeks you can work on the program as effectively anyone on the
team. The team has successfully communicated from one human to another.
</p><p>
<b>What is in the book?</b>
</p><p>
Remember our calculus textbook? It started from the ideas like limits
and gradually developed the ideas until they could be expressed in
equations. By the time you got to the equations you already understood
the concepts. You could look at the equations and see why they matched
the text. It is the <b>why</b> that is the important part. It is the
part that our programs are missing.
</p><p>
The book you took home uses the same method. You started with the problem
in chapter 1. Chapter 2 expresses the ideas needed to solve the problem.
The next few chapters expand on each idea, gradually becoming more specific
until the idea is reduced to code. By the time you get to the code it 
should be perfectly clear what the code should look like. Any part of
the code you don't understand means that the book needs some additional
words.
</p><p>
<b>The best programming language is English. Everything else is notation</b>
<h3>1.3 Literate Programming -- The basic idea</h3>
<p>
It is rather pointless to have code in a book, right? Someone could
change the code and then the book would be out of date.
</p><p>
The way to solve this problem is to extract the code directly from the 
book. That way, every time you change the code in the book you change
the actual program.
</p><p>
How hard is it to write an extraction program that can find the code in 
the book and extract it to some files? Well, lets suppose we name each
section of code and call it a <b>chunk</b>.
</p><p>
We need a program that lets us find a chunk in a document and extract it.
The traditional name for such a program is <b>tangle</b>. The tangle
program takes two arguments, the name of the book and the name of the
chunk:
<pre>
   tangle mybookname chunkname
</pre>
</p><p>
With this simple tool you can now write books that contain the actual
source code.
</p>
<h4>1.3.1 Literate Programming is <b>NOT</b> documentation</h4>
<p>
The first reaction is that this is a new, painful form of documentation.
It is not. Documentation is a <b>how</b> construct. It is a way of 
explaining how a program works or how an application interface should
be used. 
</p><p>
Literate programming is about <b>why</b>. It explains the ideas. It is
communication from one person to another. 
</p><p>
The <b>why</b> becomes important when you have to maintain and modify
a program. You can perfectly understand <b>how</b> a subroutine,
module, or class works. You can explain its input and outputs. What
you don't understand is <b>why</b> it exists. Nobody writes that
down. So when you are joining a group and given the directory
containing thousand of pieces of code, you have <b>no</b> idea why the
program is structured the way it is.
</p>
<h4>1.3.2 Literate Programming is a change in mindset</h3>
<p>
In order to do literate programming you have to change the way you
think. You have to write english text to communicate ideas. You have
to move from ideas to implementation in a way that make the <b>story</b>
clear.
</p><p>
If programmers were writing a James Bond novel they would create a
file for JamesBond, MissMoneyPenny, Q, and TheBadGuys. They would
create a directory for Scenes with subdirectories for Scene1, Scene2,
and so on. Then they would box up the whole tree, send it to the 
audience, and tell them 
<pre>
   When this program is run, the bad guy dies
</pre>
</p><p>
We live by stories. We tell stories and we remember stories.
Characters do things and the author tries to convey their motivations
(the <b>why</b>). Scenes, flashy cars, trick watches, and other items
are added to solve local problems in the story. The whole story moves
from the beginning to the end. You can remember the story and you can
find places where you think it is weak or cheesy or bad.
</p><p>
Subroutines, modules, or classes are like characters in a story. They
need motivation. They need the <b>why</b>. The factory classes, the
singletons, the garbage collection routines, and other "items" exist
to solve local problems in the <b>story</b> of the program.
</p><p>
Literate programming is about writing the story of your program. What
are you trying to solve? How are you solving it? Why did you introduce
piece of code? Is it part of the main story or is it an item that helps
solve a local problem?
</p>
<h4>1.3.3 Literate Programming reduces bugs</h3>
<p>
We are all conditioned to follow stories. We do it all the time.
If I present you with a piece of code without the story then you 
have to struggle to understand it. Take, for example, this:
</p>
<pre id="example.c">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

}

</pre>
<p>
Odds are good you just skipped over it, right? It is pretty much just a
long pile of noise. It really doesn't matter if you are a C programmer 
or not. It is just noise.
</p>
<h3>1.4 Understanding the literate programming tangle tool</h3>
<p>
We write literate programs to communicate to both people and machines.
Since they are combined in a single document we need a markup language
to distinguish human text from machine text as well as a markup language
to write readable english.
<p>
Literate programs don't care what you use as a documentation markup
language. I prefer latex but for this example we'll use HTML.
</p><p>
HTML has a set of markup tags. One of the markup tags is the <tt>pre</tt>
tag. Anything between the beginning of a <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> tag and the 
trailing <tt>&lt;/pre&gt;</tt> tag is quoted and
printed exactly as written.
</p><p>
The <tt>pre</tt> tag also has an <tt>id</tt> field which lets us put a
name on the tag. So we can have many named <tt>pre</tt> tags in a file.
</p><p>
The tangle program reads the HTML file and extracts the text in a 
<tt>pre</tt> chunk. That's almost all of the magic.
</p>
<h4>1.4.1 Motivation, or getchunk</h4>
<p>
Remember, though, that we wanted to motivate ideas in a program.
Motivations get introduced in an order that humans can understand.
So ideas have to be presented in a particular order for humans and
a different order for machines. We need a way to reorganize the
program into pieces. The trick is <b>getchunk</b>.
</p><p>
We introduce a special tag called <tt>getchunk</tt>. It only occurs
within a <tt>pre</tt> tag block. The <tt>getchunk</tt> tag has an 
<tt>id</tt> field which names another chunk. When we find a 
<tt>getchunk</tt> tag, we read the id name and replace the 
<tt>getchunk</tt> tag with the named chunk.
</p><p>
This <tt>getchunk</tt> tag allows us to "clip out" a piece of a
program from the middle of a subroutine, put it into its own chunk,
and wrap some text around it. 
</p><p>
This is useful if you have some tricky loop in the middle of a large
subroutine that you need to explain. You can clip the loop out, put it
in a <tt>pre</tt> tag of its own and replace it with a <tt>getchunk</tt>.
</p>
<h4>1.4.2 All of the literate programming tools</h4>
<p>
So we have a single program, called <b>tangle</b>. It works with three
HTML tags, the <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> tag, the <tt>&lt;/pre&gt;</tt>
 and the <tt>&lt;getchunk&gt;</tt> tag. They
look like:
<pre>
   &lt;pre id="main.c"&gt;
   &lt;/pre&gt;
   &lt;getchunk id="main.c"&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
That's all there is. 
</p><p>
Now you can embed your subroutines in an HTML file, surround it by
<tt>pre</tt> tags, replace nasty sections with <tt>getchunk</tt> tags
so you can explain them separately, and you can extract the whole
set of subroutines using the tangle program.
</p><p>
The <b>big loop</b> of program development is now:
<pre>
 do forever {
    edit the html file
    tangle thehtmlfile sub1.c >sub1.c
    tangle thehtmlfile sub2.c >sub2.c
    tangle thehtmlfile main.c >main.c
    gcc -o myfile sub1.c sub2.c main.c
    ./myfile
 }
</pre>
</p><p>
When you are finished for the day, the week, or the project your 
whole program is properly explained as well as properly maintained.
</p><p>
If you did it right you can just point someone at the HTML file,
let them go away for a while, and when they return they understand
enough about your program to take over the whole project.
</p><p>
But wait, you say... you skipped over the hard part.
</p><p>
Indeed, I did. The hard part is that you need to communicate your
ideas to another human. And you have to do it in a way that reduces
your idea to practice. In fact, you need to <b>clearly</b> reduce your
ideas to practice.
</p>
<h2>2.0 The Tangle Program</h2>
<h3>2.1 Understanding the story of the program</h3>
<p>
We will try to illustrate literate programming using the tangle
program as an example. However, if you want to see a <b>real</b>
literate program I strongly recommend the book:
<pre>
  Lisp in Small Pieces by Christian Queinnec (ISBN 0-521-54566-8)
</pre>
</p><p>
We would like to write programs embedded in documents which surround
the program text with explanations. Since the compiler cannot
understand the markup language we need a program, which we will call
tangle, that wil extract code from a document in a given markup
language.
</p><p>
The tangle program is specific to the markup language used, whether it is
latex, HTML, or some other language. For this example we are assuming
that the markup is HTML.
</p><p>
The markup language has to have some sort of <tt>verbatim</tt> quoting
mechanism which allows us to put code inline. It also has to have a way
to name the quoted pieces of code. We call the quoted pieces of code a
<tt>chunk</tt>. We call the label the <tt>chunkname</tt>.
</p><p>
HTML uses the <tt>pre</tt> tag as its quoting mechanism. Items between
the opening <tt>pre</tt> tag and the closing <tt>/pre</tt> tag are
unchanged by HTML processors. The <tt>pre</tt> tag has an <tt>id</tt>
parameter. We will use the <tt>id</tt> parameter as a chunk name.
</p><p>
The tangle program takes two arguments, the name of the document and
the name of the chunk. It must print the chunk on standard output.
</p>
<h3>2.2 The main task</h3>
<p>
The main thing we have to do is find a chunk somewhere in our book.
We specified the book and the chunk name on the command line so we
ought to check that we have the right inputs. 
</p><p>
There can only be two inputs and they are both required so first
we check that condition. If there are not two then the user might not
understand what was required so we print the usual <tt>usage</tt> message.
</p><p>
We have huge amounts of memory so we will simply load the file in a 
single chunk using the <tt>read</tt> function. This 
requires that we can open the file, which we check. It requires a
handle to the file, which we get from the open call. It requires the
size of the file so it can allocate memory, so we use <tt>fstat</tt>.
</p><p>
Now that we have all of the <tt>read</tt> parameters we can load the
file into memory. The <tt>buffer</tt> variable is described as a pointer to
a character which is C-speak for a string. 
</p><p>
We also need to know the size of the buffer at all times so we
allocate the <tt>bufsize</tt> variable at global scope.
</p>
<pre id="buffer">

/* a memory mapped buffer copy of the file */
char *buffer;
int bufsize;

</pre>
<p>
Since the buffer is being used everywhere we make it global by
defining it at the top of the program, outside the scope of the
functions.
</p>
<pre id="main">
/* memory map the input file into the global buffer and get the chunk */
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
  int fd;
  struct stat filestat;
  if ((argc != 2)) { 
    perror("Usage: tangle filename chunkname");
    exit(-1);
  }
  fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
  if (fd == -1) {
    perror("Error opening file for reading");
    exit(-2);
  }
  if (fstat(fd,&filestat) < 0) {
    perror("Error getting input file size");
    exit(-3);
  }
  bufsize = (int)filestat.st_size;
  buffer = (char *)malloc(bufsize);
  read(fd,buffer,bufsize);
  fixHTMLcode(); 
  getchunk(argv[2]);
  close(fd);
  return(0);
}

</pre>
<p>
If the <tt>read</tt> succeeds we move on to the problem of finding
the named chunk in the book.
</p>
<h3>2.3 A complication with HTML</h3>
<p>
HTML is not clever about ignoring HTML symbols in <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt>
blocks of code. This causes us three complications which do not normally
occur with a tangle program. 
</p><p>
The first complication can be seen by viewing the source for this page.
We need to replace the angle brackets with the HTML escape codes 
everywhere, including in the verbatim sections. So we have to be careful
using certain language constructs. Reasonable markup languages such
as latex do not have this problem.
</p><p>
The second complication is that the string search for the <tt>pre</tt>,
<tt>/pre</tt> and <tt>getchunk</tt> tags need to use the escape code
sequence for matching.
</p><p>
The third complication is that the tangle program has to reverse 
this translation when printing the program.
</p><p>
There is no such thing as a simple job.
</p><p>
The trick here will be to walk the buffer and replace every use of
the HTML code with the corresponding character, appropriately adjusting
the space. Since HTML codes are always longer than the character they
replace we can just compress the buffer a bit. And since the buffer is
never used for anything else we can even replace the HTML codes in parts
of the buffer where it might be inappropriate.
</p><p>
The <tt>point</tt> variable is where we are looking in the buffer.
The <tt>mark</tt> variable is where we are writing in the buffer.
Normally we just walk them in parallel. They diverge when they hit an
HTML code. The <tt>point</tt> is copied to the <tt>mark</tt>. In the
absence of any codes this is a copy of the buffer to itself.
</p><p>
When we hit a code we place the corresponding character at the <tt>mark</tt>,
bump the <tt>point</tt> over the HTML code, and continue the copy.
</p><p>
When we hit the end of the buffer we rewrite the <tt>bufsize</tt> variable
to reflect the new, shorter buffer size.
</p><p>
There is another really subtle point here. Note that we have to do the
comparison in two pieces otherwise the combined string is a valid HTML
code and we end up destroying our own search string. If we break it
into two parts then the substring "lt;" is not a valid HTML code and
will not be replaced. <b>This</b> is the kind of information that
literate programming preserves. A clever programmer would combine the
two tests into the single strncmp and everything will fail.
</p><p>
Michael Albaugh points out that this code does not handle the complete
list of escape codes. For a more general implementation we should create
a table mapping the code from the HTML version to the characters. Since
they do not occur in this example I have not done this in its full
generality. Escape codes can be numeric as well as character based
and there are several hundred of them.
</p>
<pre id="fixHTMLcode">
void fixHTMLcode() {
  int point = 0;
  int mark = 0;
  int i=0;
  for(point = 0; point < bufsize;) {
    if ((buffer[point] == '&') &&
        (strncmp(&buffer[point+1],"lt;",3) == 0)) {
      buffer[mark++] = 60;
      point = point + 4;  
    } else
    if ((buffer[point] == '&') &&
        (strncmp(&buffer[point+1],"gt;",3) == 0)) {
      buffer[mark++] = 62;
      point = point + 4;  
    } else
      buffer[mark++] = buffer[point++]; 
  }
  bufsize = mark;
}

</pre>
<h3>2.4 Finding the chunk</h3>
<p>
We are given the chunkname as a string and we have to search the
file for the <br/><tt>&lt;pre id="name"&gt;</tt> tag. 
</p><p>
Since the string came from the command line we know that it ends
with a null character so we can just call <tt>strlen</tt> to get
the length.
</p><p>
<b>By design</b>, we require the <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> tag to start in the first
character of the line. We could remove this restriction if we
felt like being clever but code is usually left-aligned in the
output so left-aligning the tag is reasonable. 
</p><p>
Given this <b>design decision</b> we can walk the book one line at a time.
We delegate the task of finding the line length <tt>linelen</tt> to
the <tt>nextline</tt> function.  The "magic number" 11 exists because
the smallest <tt>pre</tt> tag contains 11 characters:
<pre>
&lt;pre id=""&gt;
</pre>
</p><p>
If the line is long enough to contain the <tt>&lt;pre&gt;</tt> tag and its
associated <tt>id</tt> tag and we find the named chunk then we 
print it.
</p><p>
Another <b>design decision</b> is that we will allow multiple chunks with
the same name and we will print them in order. This allows us to 
break a big block into smaller blocks and insert text in the middle.
So you can write
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;pre id="somename"&gt;
       the first part of a function
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    some explanation
    &lt;pre id="somename"&gt;
       the next part of the function
    &lt;/pre&gt;
    more explanation
</pre>
When you run <tt>tangle filename somename</tt> you will see the output:
<pre>
  the first part of a function
  the next part of the function
</pre>
<p>
This is trivial to implement. All we have to do is keep searching the
document and printing the same named chunk.
</p>
<a name="getchunk"/>
<pre id="getchunk">
/* find the named chunk and call printchunk on it */
int getchunk(char *chunkname) {
  int i;
  int j;
  int linelen;
  int chunklen = strlen(chunkname);
  for (i=0; ((linelen=nextline(i)) != -1); ) {
    if ((linelen &gt;= chunklen+11) && (foundchunk(i,chunkname) == 1)) {
      i=printchunk(i,linelen,chunkname);
    } else {
      i=i+linelen+1;
    }
  }
  return(i);
}

</pre>
<h3>2.5 Finding the next line in the buffer</h3>
<p>
The <tt>nextline</tt> function just walks the buffer starting at any
character position and returns the character position after the next
newline. We only have to check that we don't run off the end of the
buffer, otherwise we just keep a count of the character position.
</p>
<pre id="nextline">
/* return the length of the next line */
int nextline(int i) {
  int j;
  if (i >= bufsize) return(-1);
  for (j=0; ((i+j < bufsize) && (buffer[i+j] != '\n')); j++);
  return(j);
}

</pre>

<h3>2.6 At last, finding the chunk</h3>
<p>
We are positioned at the beginning of a line so we are looking at
something that looks like:
<pre>
&lt;pre id="somechunkname"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
We need to check the format of the line. The first 9 characters must be:
</p>
<pre>
&lt;pre id="
</pre>
<p>
The next substring must be the chunkname we seek and the rest of
line must be the
<pre>
"&gt;
</pre>
<p>
So if we find a properly formed line with the chunk name then we 
return a 1 indicating success, otherwise we return a 0 indicating failure.
</p><p>
In a fit of hasty generality we allocate the <tt>chunkbegin</tt>
information at the global scope. In theory we would like to be able to
just change the patterns for different markup languages.
<pre id="chunkbegin">
char *chunkbegin = "&lt;pre id=\"";     int chunkbeginlen = 9;
</pre>
<pre id="foundchunk">
/* handle &lt;pre id="chunkname"&gt;            */
/* is this chunk name we are looking for? */
int foundchunk(int i, char *chunkname) {
  if ((strncmp(&buffer[i],chunkbegin,chunkbeginlen) == 0) &&
      (strncmp(&buffer[i+9],chunkname,strlen(chunkname)) == 0) &&
      (buffer[i+chunkbeginlen+strlen(chunkname)] == '"') &&
      (buffer[i+chunkbeginlen+strlen(chunkname)+1] == '&gt;')) return(1);
  return(0);
}

</pre>

<h3>2.7 Printing the chunk we found </h3>
<p>
So we found our chunk and all we have to do is print it.
We just print each line until we find the <tt>&lt;/pre&gt;</tt> tag,
a task we delegate to the <tt>foundEnd</tt> function.
</p><p>
Of course, there is no such thing as a simple job and, indeed,
there is a complication here. We made a <b>design decision</b>
that we will allow a <tt>getchunk</tt> tag to have special meaning
within the <tt>pre</tt> tag.
</p><p>
We delegate getting the <tt>id</tt> from the <tt>getchunk</tt> tag
to the <tt>getChunkname</tt> function which we will examine next.
</p><p>
Recall that <tt>getchunk</tt> will search the document for the 
<tt>pre</tt> tag named by the <tt>getchunk's</tt> <tt>id</tt> label.
This means that we need to
<pre>
  1) stop printing the current chunk
  2) find the chunk named by getchunk and print it
  3) continue printing the original chunk where we left off
</pre>
<p>
We already have a function to do step 2, the 
<a href="#getchunk">getchunk</a> function mentioned above.
We can just call that function which handles both finding and
printing a chunk.
</p>
The magic number 17 occurs because we need to account for all of
the characters in the line which are not part of the <tt>id</tt>
string in the <tt>getchunk</tt>. So an empty string, including
the trailing newline is:
<pre>
&lt;getchunk id=""&gt;\n   a total of 17 characters
</pre>
<pre id="printchunk">
/* print lines in this chunk, possibly recursing into getchunk */
int printchunk(int i, int chunklinelen, char *chunkname) {
  int j;
  int k;
  int linelen;
  char *getname;
  int getlen = 0;
  for (k=i+chunklinelen+1; ((linelen=nextline(k)) != -1); ) {
    if ((getlen=foundGetchunk(k,linelen)) > 0) {
       getname = getChunkname(k,getlen);
       getchunk(getname);
       free(getname);
       k=k+getlen+17;
    } else {
    if ((linelen >= chunkendlen) && (foundEnd(k) == 1)) {
      return(k+chunkbeginlen);
    } else {
      printline(k,linelen);
      k=k+linelen+1;
    }
  }}
  return(k);
}

</pre>

<h3>2.8 The simple case, print the line</h3>
In the simple case we simply output the line.
<pre id="printline">
/* output the line we need */
int printline(int i, int length) {
  int j; 
  for (j=0; j&lt;length; j++) { putchar(buffer[i+j]); }
  printf("\n");
}

</pre>
<h3>2.9 Checking chunks for <tt>getchunk</tt> tags</h3>
<p>
Because we treat the <tt>getchunk</tt> tag as a special case when we
are printing we need a predicate to look for it. We are positioned at
the beginning of a line when we are called so we only need to check
for the string we call <tt>chunkget</tt>, that is:
<pre id="chunkget">
char *chunkget = "&lt;getchunk id=\"";  int chunkgetlen = 14;
</pre>

This predicate returns the length of the chunkname or 0 if it is not
a <tt>getchunk</tt> tag.
<pre id="foundGetchunk">
/* handle <getchunk id="chunkname"/> */
/* is this line a getchunk?          */
int foundGetchunk(int i, int linelen) {
  int len;
  if (strncmp(&buffer[i],chunkget,chunkgetlen) == 0) {
   for(len=1; ((len < linelen) && (buffer[i+chunkgetlen+len] != '\"')); len++);
   return(len);
  }
  return(0);
}

</pre>

<h3>2.10 Getting a new chunk name from the getchunk tag</h3>
<p>
We have encountered a &lt;getChunkName&gt; tag. We need to strip out
the <tt>id</tt> string. We malloc a small piece of memory to contain
the name. Note that this is a potential memory leak since we are 
letting allocated memory leave this function. The caller must remember
to free it. If we check the caller, the <tt>printchunk</tt> function
we see that the buffer is freed and memory does not leak.
</p>
<pre id="getChunkname">
/* Somebody did a getchunk and we need a copy of the name */
/* malloc string storage for a copy of the getchunk name  */
char *getChunkname(int k, int getlen) {
  char *result = (char *)malloc(getlen+1);
  strncpy(result,&buffer[k+chunkgetlen],getlen);
  result[getlen]='\0';
  return(result);
}

</pre>

<h3>2.11 Finding the end of the chunk we are printing</h3>
<p>
The <tt>printchunk</tt> routine delegated the task of finding the
<tt>&lt;/pre&gt;</tt> tag to <tt>foundEnd</tt>. If we find the
tag we return 1 otherwise we return 0.
</p><p>
The <tt>chunkend</tt> and <tt>chunkendlen</tt> variables are allocated
in the global scope.
<pre id="chunkend">
char *chunkend = "&lt;/pre&gt;";           int chunkendlen = 6;
</pre>

<pre id="foundEnd">
/* handle &lt;/pre&gt;   */
/* is it really an end? */
int foundEnd(int i) {
  if (strncmp(&buffer[i],chunkend,chunkendlen) == 0) {
    return(1); 
  }
  return(0);
}

</pre>

<h3>2.12 Final cleanup and housekeeping. The preamble</h3>

C compilers aren't smart enough to look up symbols everyone uses so we
have to tell it where to find them. We also need to forward reference
the <tt>getchunk</tt> function because it is used before it exists.
Compilers in 1970 couldn't handle such complexity. It is terribly
hard, you know.

<pre id="include">
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/stat.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;

/* forward reference for the C compiler */
int getchunk(char *chunkname);

</pre>

<h2>3.0 The tangle source code</h2>
<p>
The big chunk of code at the beginning of this book is a working
tangle program. You can clip it out of a web page, save it as
tangle.c, type
<pre>
   gcc -o tangle tangle.c
</pre>
and you now have a working tangle program for HTML files. If you want
to improve it just modify this web page and run tangle again to extract
your changes. 
</p><p>
Alternatively you can get the tangle source code from 
<a href="http://daly.literatesoftware.com/lithtml/tangle.c">here</a>
</p><p>
When we want the whole program we output this chunk with the command:
</p>
<pre>
    tangle litprog.html tangle.c &gt;tangle.c
</pre>
and it recreates the tangle.c function.

<pre id="tangle.c">
&lt;getchunk id="include"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="chunkbegin"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="chunkend"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="chunkget"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="buffer"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="nextline"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="printline"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="foundchunk"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="foundEnd"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="foundGetchunk"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="getChunkname"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="printchunk"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="getchunk"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="fixHTMLcode"&gt;
&lt;getchunk id="main"&gt;
</pre>

<h2>4.0 What have we learned?</h2>
<p>
We have walked through a fairly simple program in great detail.  You
now understand why HTML causes problems, you understand what the magic
numbers in the program mean, and you understand the design decisions
such as always have <tt>pre</tt> tags in the first column.
</p><p>
We have learned that we only need a simple 160 line tangle program to
handle all of the literate programming tasks. You can make this more
complex if you like. You could create a tangle plugin for Eclipse. You
could add automatic indexing. Many people have done similar things
with their literate tools.
</p><p>
Ultimately, though, the <b>important</b> point is that you need to
write programs to communicate with other people. We do not do that
now. The result is that there are tens of thousands of programs on
Sourceforge and Savannah and Github that are never going to be used
because nobody understands them.
</p><p>
We can do better. We can make programs that live. We can communicate
our ideas in ways that others can understand without talking to us.
</p><p>
We can be better programmers.
</p><p>

<h2>4.0 What have we learned?</h2>
<pre>
 Guilherme Reis found that the check for the number of arguments
 was incorrect. It should have been exactly 2.

 Michael Albaugh points out that this code does not handle the complete
 of escape codes, as noted above. A production version of this code
 would have to handle that.
