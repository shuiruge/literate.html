          Consider the best possible world. You've been hired at a company and
          join a team that is already working on a program. They hand you a book,
          tell you to go home and read it over the next two weeks. At the end of
          the two weeks you can work on the program as effectively anyone on the
          team. The team has successfully communicated from one human to another.

          What is in the book? Remember our calculus textbook? It started from
          the ideas like limits and gradually developed the ideas until they could
          be expressed in equations. By the time you got to the equations you
          already understood the concepts. You could look at the equations and see
          why they matched the text. It is the <em>why</em> that is the
          important part. It is the part that our programs are missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The book you took home uses the same method. You started with the problem
          in chapter 1. Chapter 2 expresses the ideas needed to solve the problem.
          The next few chapters expand on each idea, gradually becoming more specific
          until the idea is reduced to code. By the time you get to the code it
          should be perfectly clear what the code should look like. Any part of
          the code you don't understand means that the book needs some additional words.

      Literate programming is like when you are explaining your code to a colleague.
      You have to declare what you were thinking when you wrote the code, step by
      step, piece by piece. You are telling the whole story: which step is essential,
      why the order must be so, or what is this used for. All materials are organized
      in a structure that makes sense to you (not to the compiler).
    </p>

    <p>
      Technically, literate programming has two components: <strong>weave</strong>
      and <strong>tangle</strong>. By weaving, the source code is converted to
      printable document, such as PDF or HTML. By tangling, the codes involved
      in the document are extracted and organized in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic building blocks are chunks and chunk references.
      So, for example, we can define a chunk named <code>hello.c</code>:
      <div class="chunk" name="hello.c">
        <span class="chunkref">include</span>
        int main() {
          <span class="chunkref">say hello</span>
          return 0;
        }
      </div>
      where the chunk references <span class="chunkref">include</span> and
      <span class="chunkref">say hello</span> are defined elsewhere. As an
      example, <span class="chunk" name="include">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>
      and <span class="chunk" name="say hello">printf("Hello, world!\n");</span>

      Then, by tangling, code are extracted and organized in order:
      <pre><code>
        #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
        int main() {
          printf("Hello, world!\n");
          return 0;
        }
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      The original literate programming designed by Donald Knuth is independent of
      specific programming languages. It is the pseudo code that represents the
      algorithm instead of a language specific implementation that is presented
      in a chunk. The tangling process also translates the pseudo code into a language
      specific implementation, such as PASCAL (using WEB) or C (using CWEB).
      In this document, however, we write language specific implementation instead
      pseudo code in chunk. The reason is that different languages solve the same
      problem in intrinsically different ways. For example, the trick that uses
      dictionary to reduce temporal complexity is common in object oriented languages.
      But, this trick fails in pure functional languages like Haskell where mutable
      variable such as dictionary implemented by hash-table is not allowed. For
      this reason, we suggest to use language specific implementation instead of
      pseudo code in chunk. After all, <em>it is the idea underlying the code (that
      is, the context) instead of the code itself that is really matters for our
      understanding.</em>
    </p>

    <h2>Why Using HTML</h2>
    <p>
      The main reason is that the HTML file can be displayed directly in a browser.
      So, there is no need to weave.

      Yet another benefit is that HTML provides a standard for markup languages.
      Any other markup formats (such as markdown) can be safely converted to HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing with TeX, HTML is much modern and widely used. It can be displayed
      on any device including mobile phones. There is no need to install a huge
      TeX Live environment (the minimal version is about 1GB). All you need is a
      browser.
    <p>
      The only issue is that some languages, such as HTML itself and C++, heavily
      use characters "<" and ">" in the same way as HTML, such as
      <code>vector&lt;string&gt;</code> in C++. We have to escape these "tag
      characters". But this issue is not overall. For example, the "<" character
      in <code>x < 0</code> is not "tag-like", thus there is no need to escape.
    </p>

    <h2>Chunk in HTML</h2>

    <h3>HTML Elements for Chunks</h3>
    <p>
      As usual, we use the "class" attribute to indicate chunk and chunk reference.
      Thus, block chunk is represented by <code>div</code> element with class "chunk"
      and a name attribute. <em>Chunk name shall be plain text.</em> For example:
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="chunk" name="hello.c"&gt;

          ...code block...

        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      And inline chunk is represented by <code>span</code> element with class "chunk"
      and a name attribute. For example:
      <pre><code>
        &lt;span class="chunk" name="say hello"&gt; ...one line code... &lt;/span&gt;
      </code></pre>
      Chunk reference, which is always inline, is represented by <code>span</code>
      element with class "chunkref". The referred chunk name locates in the content
      of the <code>span</code> element. Thus,
      <pre><code>
        &lt;span class="chunkref"&gt;say hello&lt;/span&gt;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <h3 id="sharing-chunk-name">Sharing Chunk Name</h3>
    <p>
      Different chunks may share the same name. For example:
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="chunk" name="include"&gt;
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      and then after some explanation,
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="chunk" name="include"&gt;
          #include &lt;math.h&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      While tangling, chunks with the same name are stacked in due order.
      Thus, the previous example is equivalent to:
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="chunk" name="include"&gt;
          #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
          #include &lt;math.h&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
    </p>

    <h3 id="prepending-newline">Prepending Newline</h3>
    <p>
      Additionally, we can add a "prepend-newline" attribute to block chunk. If a
      block chunk has this attribute, a newline character will be prepended to the
      end of the code block when it is tangled. For example:
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="chunk" name="hello.c"&gt;
          void say_hello () {
            printf("Hello, world!\n");
          }
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      followed by
      <pre><code>
        &lt;div class="chunk" name="hello.c" prepend-newline&gt;
          void say_hello_again () {
            printf("Hello, world!\n");
          }
        &lt;/div&gt;
      </code></pre>
      will be tangled into
      <pre><code>
        void say_hello () {
          printf("Hello, world!\n");
        }

        void say_hello_again () {
          printf("Hello, world!\n");
        }
      </code></pre>
      There is an empty line before the second function. It makes the code more
      readable. Otherwise, functions will be densely packed together.
    </p>
    <p>
      If "prepend-newline" is set to a number, multiple empty lines will be
      prepended. For example, <code>prepend-newline="2"</code> means prepending
      two newline characters.
      This is the case for Python (see <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#blank-lines">PEP8</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>

    <p>
      While you are reading through this document, you may meet the block chunks
      named <code>literate.js</code> and <code>literate.css</code>. Then, click
      the head of each block chunk, and the tangled code will popup in a new tab.
      This is the JavaScript and CSS code for writing literate programming in HTML,
      just like this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you find this document too long to read, then just download the JavaScript
      and CSS code from the repository hosted on
      <a href="https://github.com/shuiruge/literate.html/tree/v1">GitHub</a> (or
      <a href="https://gitee.com/shuiruge/literate.html/tree/v1">Gitee</a> for Chinese users).
      They locate in the <code>literate.js</code> and the <code>literate.css</code>
      respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      After obtaining the two files, put them in your HTML head. For example,
      <pre><code>
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="literate.css"/&gt;
        &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="literate.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
      </code></pre>
      Then, remember to weave when onload. For example,
      <pre><code>
        &lt;script&gt;
          window.onload = weaveAll;
        &lt;/script&gt;
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you can start your own journey of literate programming!
    </p>

    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>
    <p>
      In the rest of this document, we implement the JavaScript code for our purpose.
      We also add some style to make it pretty. You can try to click the head of each
      block chunk, and get a surprise (a new tab will popup). Clicking chunk reference
      is fun too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us continue and (try to) enjoy this trip.
    </p>

    <h2>Weaving</h2>
    <p>
      Chunks are woven to display in browser. We use JavaScript to convert
      the HTML elements of chunks and chunk references into the those that are
      more suitable for display and cooperating with CSS.
    </p>

    <h3>Unweaving</h3>
    <p>
      Weaving will in-place modify the <code>innerHTML</code> of chunks and chunk
      references. Then, when we want to tangle them, we need to unweave them first.
      For avoiding this complexity, we store the original chunk or chunk reference
      in a new element (the same type as the original) with the class "unwoven"
      and set it as hidden for not displaying in browser. Therefore, unweaving is
      nothing but extracting the element with class "unwoven" from the woven.
      (If not found, throw an error.)
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js">
        function unweave(elem) {
          for (var i = 0; i < elem.children.length; i++) {
            var child = elem.children[i];
            if (child.getAttribute("class") == "unwoven") {
              return child;
            }
          }
          throw new Error(`[unweave] no unwoven span found in element: "${elem.innerHTML}"`);
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Weaving Chunk Reference</h3>
    <p>
      We first deal with chunk reference. Chunk reference is displayed in the format
      <pre><code>
        ⟨&lt;a href="chunk-name"&gt;chunk name&lt;/a&gt;⟩
      </code></pre>
      within the original <code>&lt;span class="chunkref"&gt;</code> element.
      The hyperlink links to the <em>first</em> chunk with the referred chunk name.
      To do so, we have to add an <code>id</code> attribute to that first chunk.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function weaveChunkRef(chunkRef) {
          <span class="chunkref">create unwoven span for weaving chunk reference</span>
          <span class="chunkref">create id and link to the first chunk</span>
          <span class="chunkref">replace innerHTML for weaving chunk reference</span>
        }
      </div>
      We create a <code>span</code> element for the unwoven, which stores the original
      <code>innerHTML</code> before weaving. For not displaying the unwoven, we set
      to be hidden.
      <div class="chunk" name="create unwoven span for weaving chunk reference">
        /* Create unwoven span */
        var unwoven = document.createElement("span");
        unwoven.setAttribute("class", "unwoven");
        unwoven.setAttribute("hidden", true);
        unwoven.innerHTML = chunkRef.innerHTML;
      </div>
      Then, find the first chunk with the referred chunk name, and add an <code>id</code>
      to it for linking. Since there may be whitespace in the chunk name, which is
      not valid in ID, we use "-" for replacing.
      <div class="chunk" name="create id and link to the first chunk">
        /* Create id and link to the first chunk */
        var id = null;
        var chunkName = chunkRef.innerHTML;
        var chunks = document.getElementsByName(chunkName);
        for (var i = 0; i < chunks.length; i++) {
          if (chunks[i].getAttribute("class") != "chunk") continue;
          id = chunkName.replace(" ", "-");
          chunks[i].setAttribute("id", id);
          break;
        }
      </div>
      If there is no chunk with the referred chunk name, there must be something
      wrong, we raise an error.
      <div class="chunk" name="create id and link to the first chunk">
        if (id == null) throw new Error(`[weaveChunkRef] no chunk found for "${chunkName}"`);
      </div>
      Then, we create the link to the first chunk.
      <div class="chunk" name="create id and link to the first chunk">
        var link = document.createElement("a");
        link.setAttribute("href", `#${id}`);
        link.setAttribute("class", "chunkref-link");
        link.innerHTML = chunkName;
      </div>
      Now, we clean up the <code>chunkRef</code> element and add the link and
      the unwoven <code>span</code> to it.
      <div class="chunk" name="replace innerHTML for weaving chunk reference">
        /* Replace HTML */
        chunkRef.innerHTML = null;
        chunkRef.appendChild(document.createTextNode("⟨"));
        chunkRef.appendChild(link);
        chunkRef.appendChild(document.createTextNode("⟩"));
        chunkRef.appendChild(unwoven);
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Weaving Inline Chunk</h3>
    <p>
      Then, consider inline chunk. Inline chunk is displayed in the format
      <pre><code>
        &lt;span class="inline-chunk-head"&gt;⟨chunk name⟩≡&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;code&gt;... one line code ...&lt;/code&gt;
      </code></pre>
      within the original <code>&lt;span class="chunk"&gt;</code> element.
      If the chunk is not the first of the series of chunks that share the
      same chunk name, then we replace the <code>≡</code> by <code>+≡</code>.
      We add a <code>span</code> element for the head:
      <div class="chunk" name="create head for inline chunk">
        /* Create chunk head span */
        var chunkHead = document.createElement("span");
        chunkHead.setAttribute("class", "inline-chunk-head");
        if (isFirstChunk(chunk)) {
          chunkHead.innerHTML = `⟨${chunk.getAttribute("name")}⟩≡`;
        } else {
          chunkHead.innerHTML = `⟨${chunk.getAttribute("name")}⟩+≡`;
        }
      </div>
      And the one line code is wrapped in a <code>code</code> element:
      <div class="chunk" name="create code for inline chunk">
        /* Create code */
        var code = document.createElement("code");
        code.innerHTML = chunk.innerHTML;
      </div>
      Again, we shall append an unwoven span to the inline chunk. So, we simply
      follow the code in <code>weaveChunkRef</code> with a little adaptation.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function weaveInlineChunk(chunk) {
          /* Create unwoven span */
          var unwoven = document.createElement("span");
          unwoven.setAttribute("class", "unwoven");
          unwoven.setAttribute("hidden", true);
          unwoven.innerHTML = chunk.innerHTML;

          <span class="chunkref">create head for inline chunk</span>

          <span class="chunkref">create code for inline chunk</span>

          /* Replace HTML */
          chunk.innerHTML = null;
          chunk.appendChild(chunkHead);
          chunk.appendChild(code);
          chunk.appendChild(unwoven);
        }
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      The function <code>isFirstChunk</code> that tests if this chunk is the
      first of the series is easy to implement. We fir
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function isFirstChunk(chunk) {
          var chunkName = chunk.getAttribute("name");
          var chunks = document.getElementsByClassName("chunk");
          for (var i = 0; i < chunks.length; i++) {
            var chunk2 = chunks[i];
            if (chunk2.getAttribute("name") != chunkName) continue;
            return (chunk === chunk2);
          }
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Weaving Block Chunk</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, consider block chunk. Almost the same as inline chunk, block chunk
      should be displayed in the format
      <pre><code>
        &lt;span class="block-chunk-head"&gt;⟨chunk name⟩≡&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
          ... code block ...
        &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      </code></pre>
      within the original <code>&lt;div class="chunk"&gt;</code> element.
      But, we add a link to the head, clicking which will tangle the chunk.
      Thus, the head span turns into
      <pre><code>
        ⟨&lt;a onclick="tangle(chunkName)"&gt;chunkName&lt;/a&gt;⟩≡
      </code></pre>
      For the tangle link, we have:
      <div class="chunk" name="chunk head span for block chunk">
        /* Create chunk head span */
        var tangleLink = document.createElement("a");
        var chunkName = chunk.getAttribute("name");
        tangleLink.setAttribute("href", "javascript:void(0)");
        tangleLink.setAttribute("onclick", `tangle('${chunkName}')`);
        tangleLink.innerHTML = chunkName;
      </div>
      Then, we create the head and append everything in order.
      <div class="chunk" name="chunk head span for block chunk">
        var chunkHead = document.createElement("span");
        chunkHead.setAttribute("class", "block-chunk-head");
        chunkHead.appendChild(document.createTextNode("⟨"));
        chunkHead.appendChild(tangleLink);
        if (isFirstChunk(chunk)) {
          chunkHead.appendChild(document.createTextNode("⟩≡"));
        } else {
          chunkHead.appendChild(document.createTextNode("⟩+≡"));
        }
      </div>
      The unwoven now becomes a <code>div</code> element. So, the code for weaving
      block chunk simply an adaptation of <code>weaveInlineChunk</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function weaveBlockChunk(chunk) {
          /* Create unwoven span */
          var unwoven = document.createElement("div");
          unwoven.setAttribute("class", "unwoven");
          unwoven.setAttribute("hidden", true);
          unwoven.innerHTML = chunk.innerHTML;

          <span class="chunkref">chunk head span for block chunk</span>

          /* Create pre */
          var pre = document.createElement("pre");
          var code = document.createElement("code");
          code.innerHTML = chunk.innerHTML;
          pre.appendChild(code);

          /* Replace HTML */
          chunk.innerHTML = null;
          chunk.appendChild(chunkHead);

    <h3 id="regularize-code-block">Regularize Code Block</h3>
    <p>
      A widely known problem is the whitespace before the "code block". Browser
      will display these whitespace, which is not what we intend. To solve this,
      we have to regularize the code block wrapped by a <code>pre</code> element.
      For example, code block like this:
      <pre><code>
        &lt;pre&gt;
          if (i = 0) {
            i++;
          }
        &lt;/pre&gt;
      </code></pre>
      has the raw text (<code>\n</code> for newline and <code>\s</code> for whitespace):
      <pre><code>
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;<strong>\n\s\s\s\s\s\s</strong>if<strong>\s</strong>(i<strong>\s</strong>=<strong>\s</strong>0)<strong>\s</strong>{<strong>\n\s\s\s\s\s\s\s\s</strong>i++;<strong>\n\s\s\s\s\s\s</strong>}<strong>\n\s\s\s\s</strong>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      </code></pre>
      There are six extra whitespace in front of each line, and four whitespace
      after the while code block. There is also an extra newline in front of the
      code block.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are to remove these extra characters.      
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function regularizeCodeBlock(text) {
          <span class="chunkref">define regularization</span>
        }
      </div>
      We need to figure out the indentation (the six extra whitespace in front
      of each line). We use the whitespace in front of the first line of code
      as the indentation of the whole code block.

      We also need to count the number of whitespace in front of each line
      (<code>whitespaceCount</code>) and subtract indentation from it.
      Consider the line <code>i++;</code> in the previous example, it has
      <code>whitespaceCount = 8</code> and <code>indentation = 6</code>, so this
      line is indented by 2 whitespace (<code>whitespaceCount - indentation</code>).
      In addition, a flag for the state of counting is found helpful.
      <div class="chunk" name="define regularization">
        var result = "";
        var indentation = 0;
        var whitespaceCount = 0;
        var counting = false;
        for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
          <span class="chunkref">walk through text for regularization</span>
        }
      </div>

      Let us go through the text. When we have not meet any code character, the
      <code>result</code> is empty. In this case, we omit the newlines. 
      If we have not encountered any character of the code block, but whitespace,
      indicating that this maybe the first line of code, we increase <code>indentation</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="walk through text for regularization">
        if ((result == "") && (text[i] == ' ')) {
          indentation++;
        }
      </div>
      But, it maybe an empty line, a line with only whitespace. So, after a newline
      break, we reset the <code>indentation</code>, expecting for the first line of
      code.
      <div class="chunk" name="walk through text for regularization">
        else if ((result == "") && (text[i] == '\n')) {
          indentation = 0;
        }
      </div>
      Now we have considered the case when <code>result</code> is empty, and only
      encountering the newline and whitespace. Now, if a code character appears
      we append it to <code>result</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="walk through text for regularization">
        else if (result == "") {
          result += text[i];
        }
      </div>
      Now, <code>result</code> is not empty any more, and thus <code>indentation</code>
      is fixed.
      We continue appending new code character to <code>result</code> until we meet a
      newline. In this case, we set <code>counting</code> to <code>true</code>, and
      start counting whitespace. The counting ends when we encounter a code character.
      In the end, do not forget to append this newline character to <code>result</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="walk through text for regularization">
        else if (text[i] == '\n') {
          whitespaceCount = 0;
          counting = true;
          result += text[i];
        }
      </div>
      Then, we continue counting whitespace until we meet a code character.
      <div class="chunk" name="walk through text for regularization">
        else if ((counting == true) && (text[i] == ' ')) {
          whitespaceCount++;
        }
      </div>
      When we meet a character which is neither newline or whitespace, we find a
      code character. Then, we stop counting, and append the correct number of
      whitespace in front of the line of code.
      (We also check that <code>whitespaceCount</code> is greater than <code>indentation</code>,
      as it should be.)
      In the end, we append the code character to <code>result</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="walk through text for regularization">
        else if (counting == true) {
          counting = false;
          if (whitespaceCount < indentation) throw new Error("[regularizeCodeBlock] indentation error");
          for (var j = 0; j < (whitespaceCount - indentation); j++) result += " ";
          result += text[i];
        }
      </div>
      We have dealt with the whitespace in front of a line of code. Before going
      into the next line, all we need to do is appending new code characters to
      <code>result</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="walk through text for regularization">
        else {
          result += text[i];
        }
      </div>
      Up to now, we have solved the problem in front of each line of code. The
      previous example is regularized to
      <pre><code>
        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;<strong></strong>if<strong>\s</strong>(i<strong>\s</strong>=<strong>\s</strong>0)<strong>\s</strong>{<strong>\n\s\s</strong>i++;<strong>\n</strong>}<strong>\n</strong>&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
      </code></pre>
      Notice that there is still an extra newline character in the end of the code
      block. And there may be multiple ending newline characters in other examples.
      To remove it, we iterate the result in backward direction and remove newlines
      until encountering another character.
      <div class="chunk" name="define regularization">
        for (var i = (result.length - 1); i >= 0; i--) {
          if (result[i] == '\n') {
            result = result.substring(0, i);
          }
          else {
            break;
          }
        }
      </div>
      Now, it becomes what we intend to write. It is safely to return the result.
      <div class="chunk" name="define regularization">
        return result;
      </div>
    <p>
      We have implemented the function for regularizing code in block chunk. Other
      code blocks in the HTML file wrapped in <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code>
      element also need regularization. So, we regularize both of them; the order
      is irrelevant.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function regularizeAll() {
          <span class="chunkref">regularize block chunk</span>
          <span class="chunkref">regularize code in pre</span>
        }
      </div>
      wherein
      <div class="chunk" name="regularize block chunk">
        var divs = document.getElementsByTagName("div");
        for (var i = 0; i < divs.length; i++) {
          if (divs[i].getAttribute("class") == "chunk") {
            divs[i].innerHTML = regularizeCodeBlock(divs[i].innerHTML);
          }
        }
      </div>
      and
      <div class="chunk" name="regularize code in pre">
        var pres = document.getElementsByTagName("pre");
        for (var i = 0; i < pres.length; i++) {
          var codes = pres[i].getElementsByTagName("code");
          for (var j = 0; j < codes.length; j++) {
            codes[j].innerHTML = regularizeCodeBlock(codes[j].innerHTML);
          }
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3 id="weave-all">Weave All</h3>
    Now, we have had the all the functions for weaving. The order of weaving
    chunk references and chunks is irrelevant. So, after regularization, we weave
    chunk references and chunks one by one. The order of weaving is irrelevant.
    Here, we weave chunk references first.
    <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
      function weaveAll() {
        regularizeAll();
        <span class="chunkref">weave chunk references</span>
        <span class="chunkref">weave chunks</span>
      }
    </div>
    Weaving chunk references is straight forward. We use a stupid loop to
    implement it.
    <div class="chunk" name="weave chunk references">
      /* Weave chunk references */
      var chunkRefs = document.getElementsByClassName("chunkref");
      for (var i = 0; i < chunkRefs.length; i++) {
        weaveChunkRef(chunkRefs[i]);
      }
    </div>
    Weaving chunks is a little more complicated, since chunks can be inline
    (a <code>span</code>) or block (a <code>div</code>).
    <div class="chunk" name="weave chunks">
      /* Weave chunks */
      var chunks = document.getElementsByClassName("chunk");
      for (var i = 0; i < chunks.length; i++) {
        var chunk = chunks[i];
        if (chunk.tagName == "SPAN") {
          weaveInlineChunk(chunk);
        }
        else if (chunk.tagName == "DIV") {
          weaveBlockChunk(chunk);
        }
        else {
          throw new Error(`[weave] unknown chunk type: "${chunk.tagName}"`);
        }
      }
    </div>

    <h2>Tangling</h2>

    <h3>Tangling Each Chunk</h3>
    <p>
      The main process of tangling is implemented by a function <code>_tangle</code>,
      which accepts a string <code>chunkName</code> and returns a string for the
      tangled code:
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function _tangle(chunkName) {
          var code = "";
          <span class="chunkref">define _tangle</span>
          return code;
        }
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      To define <code>_tangle</code>, we first collect all chunks that have the name
      <code>chunkName</code>.
      As stated in a <a href="#sharing-chunk-name">previous section</a>, there can be
      multiple chunks with the same name.
      <div class="chunk" name="define _tangle">
        var chunks = document.getElementsByName(chunkName);
        for (var i = 0; i < chunks.length; i++) {
          var chunk = chunks[i];
          if (chunk.getAttribute("class") != "chunk") continue;
          <span class="chunkref">tangle each chunk</span>
        }
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      If the chunk has an <a href="#prepending-newline">"prepend-newline" attribute</a>,
      we append a newline character to the end of the code string according to its
      value.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        /* Prepend newline */
        var prependNewline = chunk.getAttribute("prepend-newline");
      </div>
      If there is no such attribute, <code>prependNewline</code> will be <code>null</code>.
      And we set <code>prependNewline</code> to zero (append zero newline).
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        if (prependNewline == null) {
          prependNewline = 0;
        }
      </div>
      And if it has no value (thus <code>prependNewline</code> is an empty string),
      we append a single newline character.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        else if (prependNewline == "") {
          prependNewline = 1;
        }
      </div>
      Otherwise, we parse the value as an integer and append that many newline characters.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        else if (!isNaN(prependNewline)) {
          prependNewline = parseInt(prependNewline);
        }
      </div>
      Finally, if it has incorrect value, we raise an error.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        else {
          throw new Error(`[_tangle] the value of prepend-newline must be an integer, but got "${prependNewline}"`);
        }
      </div>
      After determine the value of <code>prependNewline</code>, we append that many
      newline characters to the end of <code>code</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        for (var j = 0; j < prependNewline; j++) code += "\n";
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      For each chunk we find, we first unweave it. Since we will replace chunk
      references in it with the corresponding tangled code, that is, we will
      manipulate it in-place, we need to make a copy of it, a deep copy.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        var unwoven = unweave(chunk).cloneNode(true);
      </div>
      To find a chunk reference and replace it with the code in the referred chunk,
      we must take care. Replacing the chunk reference with the corresponding code
      will modify the children of the unwoven chunk, so using for-loop like
      <pre><code>
        for (int i = 0; i < unwoven.getElementsByClass("chunkref").length; i++)
      </code></pre>
      leads to mistakes. Instead, we employ a function that get the first child of
      the unwoven chunk that represents a chunk reference. After replacement, the
      first child of chunk reference will automatically turns to the next.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        /* Deal with chunk references */
        var chunkRef = getFirstChildByClass(unwoven, "chunkref");
        while (chunkRef != undefined) {
          <span class="chunkref">replace chunk reference</span>
          chunkRef = getFirstChildByClass(unwoven, "chunkref");
        }
      </div>
      After replacing all chunk references within the unwoven chunk, we append it
      to the <code>code</code> string. Besides, we also add a newline character
      between different chunks that share the same chunk name.
      <div class="chunk" name="tangle each chunk">
        code += unwoven.innerHTML;
        if (i < chunks.length - 1) code += "\n";
      </div>
    </p>
    <p>
      The implementation of <code>getFirstChildByClass</code> is straight forward.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function getFirstChildByClass(node, className) {
          for (var i = 0; i < node.children.length; i++) {
            var child = node.children[i];
            if (child.getAttribute("class") == className) {
              return child;
            }
          }
          return undefined;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Replacing Chunk Reference</h3>
    <p>
      For the replacement, we first get the referred chunk name. To distinguish
      with the input <code>chunkName</code>, we call it <code>subChunkName</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="replace chunk reference">
        var subChunkName = unweave(chunkRef).innerHTML;
      </div>
      Then, we get the tangled code by <strong>recursion!</strong>
      Just like <code>subChunkName</code>, we call it <code>subCode</code>.
      <div class="chunk" name="replace chunk reference">
        var subCode = _tangle(subChunkName);
      </div>
      Very simple, isn't it? Remark that, if the referred chunk is a block chunk,
      which involve multiple lines, then we have to indent the second, third, ...
      lines of the <code>subCode</code> so that they share the same indentation.
      (The first line has correct indentation, since it is written by you.) So,
      for a block chunk, we have to determine the indentation and add it to each
      line.
      <div class="chunk" name="replace chunk reference">
        /* Block chunk needs indentation */
        if (chunk.tagName == "DIV") {
          var indentation = getIndentation(chunkRef);
          subCode = indent(subCode, indentation);
        }
      </div>
      Everything is ready. Now we replace the chunk reference with the tangled
      <code>subCode</code>. Since <code>replaceWith</code> method requires an
      element (node) as input, we shall wrap the string <code>subCode</code> by
      a <code>span</code> element.
      <div class="chunk" name="replace chunk reference">
        var subCodeNode = document.createElement("span");
        subCodeNode.innerHTML = subCode;
        chunkRef.replaceWith(subCodeNode);
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Display in Browser</h3>
    <p>
      By clicking the "⟨chunk name⟩≡", function <code>tangle(chunkName)</code> is
      triggered. We popup a new window to show the tangled code, thus:
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function tangle(chunkName) {
          var code = _tangle(chunkName);
          <span class="chunkref">create HTML for the tangled code</span>
          <span class="chunkref">display HTML in a new window</span>
        }
      </div>
      We use the following HTML to display the tangled code:
      <div class="chunk" name="create HTML for the tangled code">
        html = `&lt;!doctype html&gt;&lt;html&gt;` +
               `&lt;head&gt;&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;title&gt;${chunkName}&lt;/title&gt;` +
               `&lt;style&gt;body { background-color: #c7edcc; }&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;` +
               `&lt;body&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;${code}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/body&gt;` +
               `&lt;/html&gt;`;
      </div>
      This HTML is to be displayed in a new window:
      <div class="chunk" name="display HTML in a new window">
        var win = window.open('about:blank', '_blank');
        win.document.write(html);
        win.document.close();
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Utility Functions</h3>
    <p>
      Before ending this section, we have to show how the functions <code>getIndentation</code>
      and <code>indent</code> are implemented. They turns out to be simple.
      The <code>getIndentation</code> function just returns the indentation
      of the first line of the code. For example, in the following code,
      <pre><code>
        void main() {
          &lt;span class="chunkref"&gt;say hello&lt;/span&gt;;
        }
      </code></pre>
      the chunk reference (the second line) has indentation 2. We have to figure
      it out. To do so, we first extract all the string before the chunk reference,
      which, in this example, is
      <pre><code>
        void main() {
          (end here)
      </code></pre>
      This is done by the following function (<span class="comment">We follow
        <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/72545166/1218716">this answer</a>.
        This implementation, however, cannot deal with HTML tags properly.
        Precisely, any HTML tag in the returned <code>textBefore</code> are excluded.
        But since it is called for tangling, there is not HTML tags in the text
        before the <code>node</code>, this implementation is still valid. Temporally,
        I cannot figure out a better implementation.</span>):
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function getTextBefore(node) {
          const rangeBefore = document.createRange();
          rangeBefore.setStart(node.parentNode.firstChild, 0);
          rangeBefore.setEndBefore(node);
          const textBefore = rangeBefore.toString();
          return textBefore;
        }
      </div>
      Then, directly, we count how many whitespace between the front of the chunk
      chunk reference and beginning of the line.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function getIndentation(chunkRef) {
          var textBefore = getTextBefore(chunkRef);
          var indentation = 0;
          for (var i = textBefore.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (textBefore[i] == ' ') {
              indentation++;
            } else {
              break;
            }
          }
          return indentation;
        }
      </div>
      The <code>indent</code> function is also straight forward. We simply prepend
      <code>indentation</code> many whitespace before each line.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.js" prepend-newline>
        function indent(text, indentation) {
          var result = "";
          for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
            result += text[i];
            if (text[i] == '\n') {
              for (var j = 0; j < indentation; j++) result += ' ';
            }
          }
          return result;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h2>On Loading</h2>
    <p>
      Congratulations! You are in the end of this journey. Everything left is to
      weave this HTML file when it is loaded in your browser.
      (Recall that <a href="#regularize-code-block">regularization</a> has been
      included as a part of <code><a href="#weave-all">weaveAll</a></code>.)
      So, we shall write in <code>literate.js</code>:
      <pre><code>
        onload = weaveAll;
      </code></pre>
      But, what if you want to load more JavaScript functions while loading the
      document? Who knows what you are going to do. So, it would be left to you,
      the user, to determine what the <code>onload</code> should be like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up to now, we have completed the JavaScript code for literate programming.
    </p>

    <h2>Style</h2>

    <p>
      Wait a minute for adding some style to make the document pretty.
      We use CSS to style the chunks and chunk references.
    </p>

    <h3>Inline Code</h3>
    <p>
      We add a thin border to inline code and pad it a little to make it stand out.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.css">
        code {
          border-style: dashed;
          border-width: 0.1em;
          padding-left: 0.3em;
          padding-right: 0.3em;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Code Block</h3>
    <p>
      We put code block into a block, of course. The block is wrapped by a dashed
      grey border. We also adjust the position of the code, to move it toward the
      center of the border.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.css">
        pre code {
          display: block;
          border-style: dashed;
          border-color: grey;
          border-width: medium;
          overflow-x: auto;
          margin: 1em;
          padding-left: 3em;
          padding-right: 3em;
          padding-top: 1em;
          padding-bottom: 1em;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Chunk Reference</h3>

    <p>
      For chunk reference, we delete the ugly underline of hyperlink, which links
      to the first chunk with the referred name, and pad a little for making it
      pretty. The original hyperlink color is too bright, we use dark red instead.
      (Comparing with dark blue, red color is more distinguishable.)
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.css">
        .chunkref a {
          color: darkred;
          text-decoration: none;
          padding-left: 0.1em;
          padding-right: 0.1em;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Chunk</h3>

    <p>
      For each chunk, we add a narrow margin to make it appear a little isolated
      from the content.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.css">
        div.chunk {
          margin-top: 1em;
          margin-bottom: 1em;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h4>Block Chunk</h4>
    <p>
      For block chunk, we make the head bold, indicating a definition (we always
      make something bold when it is defined).
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.css">
        .block-chunk-head {
          font-weight: bold;
        }
      </div>
      For the link in the block chunk, we use the same style as chunk reference.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.css">
        .block-chunk-head a {
          text-decoration: none;
          padding-left: 0.1em;
          padding-right: 0.1em;
          color: darkred;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

    <h3>Inline Chunk</h3>
    <p>
      For inline chunk, we simply make the head bold, indicating a definition,
      and add a very narrow padding to isolate it from the content.
      <div class="chunk" name="literate.css">
        .inline-chunk-head {
          font-weight: bold;
          padding-left: 0.1em;
          padding-right: 0.1em;
        }
      </div>
    </p>

  </body>
</html>
